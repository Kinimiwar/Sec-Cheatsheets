# 6443 Exam

### Guideline

**Structure**  
At the beginning of the 24 hours you will get given a target scope, for example: *.exam.ns.agency.

Use you recon skills to find 5 subdomains:
* 3 easy domains
* 2 slightly harder domains (requiring permutation, for example: something-qa.exam.ns.agency

There is 1 vulnerability per website, hack each site and retrieve the flag
Write up each vulnerability as you would for a break assignment and submit one report.
You will be marked according to the same criteria you are marked on for a break assignment report except a leaner more 'bug bounty' style report is acceptable given exam conditions.

The vulnerability classes (tentatively) examined will be the following:
* 1 XSS
* 1 SQLi
* 1 Authorisation/IDOR
* 1 Authentication
* 1 Server Side
 
Exam notification
* XSS Flags are in the admin cookie. Please steal. There will be a bot to retrieve your request or payload (depending on the challenge).
* SQLI Flags are in a database table called flag, column flag
* LFI/Server side attack flags are in a file on the filesystem called /flag
* IDOR Flags will be with an ID of 9447
* Account/authentication flaws will be in an account called 'admin' with id = 1

### Brian Notes

**Authorisation/IDOR + Authentication**

Authorisation: *Is the user who they claim to be?*  
Session Management: *Is it still that user?*  
Access Control: *Is the user allowed to access this thing?*  

Consider:
* Your IDOR brute force script: `~/Dropbox/_SECTOOLS/X_Scripts/login_bruteforce.py`
   * Think about the IDOR pattern / how you can intelligently brute-force it, as not all id values are a simply increment to grab the next resource.
* Cookies / base64 decode
* View source code (flag or info can be hidden there)
* LFI / LFD

Access Control:
* Horizontal / Vertical

**XSS**
* Admin XSS focus means you will have to re-direct the admin offsite to steal their cookies.
* **Requestbin** seems to work well, otherwise use **Webhookinbox** or your Amazon EC2 instance.
* An admin bot will be retrieving your payload, which in turn will execute it and return the admin flag back to your server.
   * As a result, **double de-coding** will likely occur so you will need to double-encode your payloads.
   * Check the 6843 XSS payloads cheatsheet to see how to do this properly (proven example)

**SQLi**  

Consider:


**Server Side Shit**
